Installing prerequisites
===============

Please review the instructions below.  The follow instructions assume that you do not have python installed and that you are running centos 7.  I use a docker container for this.

  # yum install -y https://repo.ius.io/ius-release-el7.rpm
  # yum -y update
  # yum install -y wget systemd openssl-devel sudo vim python36u python36u-libs python36u-devel python36u-pip
  # yum groupinstall -y "Development Tools"
  # cd /bin
  # cd $OLDPWD
  # wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.6/cmake-3.6.2.tar.gz
  # tar -zxvf cmake-3.6.2.tar.gz
  # cd cmake-3.6.2
  # ./bootstrap --prefix=/usr/local
  # make
  # make install
  # pip3 install wheel
  # pip3 install pyinstaller
  # pip3 install termcolor
  # CFLAGS="-fpermissive -std=c++11" pip3 install parallel-ssh


Installing parallell-ssh-cli
===============

parallell-ssh-cli is supported on Python 3.1 and greater

If you don't already have setuptools installed:

  # wget 'http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py'
  # sudo python3 ez_setup.py

Then:

  # sudo python3 setup.py install

Share and enjoy!
